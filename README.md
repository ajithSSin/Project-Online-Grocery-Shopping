# Project Name: Online-Grocery-Shopping
**Project Description:**

The Online Grocery Shopping System is a digital platform that allows customers to purchase groceries and household items conveniently through the internet. Instead of visiting physical stores, users can browse products, compare prices, add items to their virtual cart, and place orders online from the comfort of their homes.

This system simplifies the grocery shopping experience by integrating product listings, cart management, secure online payments, and home delivery services in one platform. 

Customers can register or log in, explore various product categories and complete their purchase using multiple payment options like credit/debit cards, UPI. Once an order is confirmed, it is processed by the store’s backend team for packaging and delivery.

The system is built using modern web technologies — typically with React.js on the frontend, Node.js and Express.js on the backend, and a MongoDB database to store user and product data securely. Authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure secure access.

Overall, the Online Grocery Shopping System provides a convenient, time-saving, and efficient way for customers to shop for everyday essentials while helping grocery stores expand their reach through digital transformation.

**Requirements**

A Node.js API

A MongoDB database

A React frontend

A full-stack app (Node + MongoDB + React)


**Step-by-step: Build & run with Docker Compose**
**Docker Compose file**

**Specify requirements in the Docker file for the Backend and Frontend**

**Backend (server/Dockerfile) — (Node):**

**Docker file for Backend**

FROM node:20.19.1

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

CMD ["node","index.js"]


**Frontend (client/Dockerfile)-(React):**

**Docker file for Frontend**

FROM node:20.19.1

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json .

COPY package-lock.json .

RUN npm install

COPY . .

CMD ["npm", "run", "dev", "--host"]

**Place a Docker Compose file at the project root**

**Docker Compose file**

Step 1:**Build & run**

*Build images and start*

docker compose up --build    

Step 2:**Verify service status & logs**

a) check for docker container

   docker ps -a

b)to open an interactive terminal(shell) inside a running Docker container.

  docker exec -it (container-id) bash
  
c) to view the files inside the container

    ls
    
d) to exit the container

  exit
  
e) Open in browser 

    Frontend: http://localhost:4000

Step 3:**Stop**

docker compose down
